Redis is a high performance and space efficient in-memory database that can be used for all sort of things, like storing  session data and inter-process communication.

You can install it on your machine, but the installation and configuration process take some time

Here is a cloud service that offer 30Mb of free fully managed Redis server that includes native JSON module
